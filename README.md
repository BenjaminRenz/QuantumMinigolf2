# QuantumMinigolf2
Quantum Minigolf simulates a wave packet and displays the result in with 3d graphics.

The current release is made for use with a touch screen display, so it is a bit impractical to use it with a mouse.

If you just want to run the game use the executable in the latest v0.X folder. The exe in the bin folder is not able to run stanalon because of missing libraries which are present in the v0.X Folders.
